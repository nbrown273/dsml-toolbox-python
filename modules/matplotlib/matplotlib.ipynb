    "# Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a object oriented plotting framework that gives developers full control over the plotting region including axes, legends, markers, labels, annotations, and more. The framework also has several convenient alternatives for quickly producing plots when exploration is the focus over production quality. Most of these quick alternatives have been scattered through the previous notebooks. Here, we focus on the object oriented approach through three sets of examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every common use case of the OOP framework approaches with the same pattern:\n",
    "1. Setup the figure and axes\n",
    "2. Specify plot type and options\n",
    "3. Annotate the plot\n",
    "4. (Optional) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each sub plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, most of the differences are due to plot types and/or options specified in step 2. As a result it's very easy to pick up the usage pattern from a couple examples; the rest comes from building experience and knowledge of the numerous options available. (These examples are slightly modified forms of the examples from matplotlibs official gallery, https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html)"
