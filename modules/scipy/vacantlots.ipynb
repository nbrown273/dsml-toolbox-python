    "The project has been given a foundation below. Most of the imports you will require are already made, but it's up to you to use the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html) for the scipy methods and underlying algorithms to figure out how to solve your challenge. There is documentation of the dataset available at the Vacancy Portal [homepage](https://www.stlvacancy.com/portal.html) as well. Your goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use interpolation to create a function that returns the estimated assessed value for any vacant parcel in St. Louis. \n",
    "2. Create a 2D contour plot of the interpolated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Geospatial techniques would be better suited; however, I've avoided using them here in order to keep the focus on interpolation. If you finish early or have a background in geo spatial, feel free to bring in other packages or explore the second interpolation method imported below."
